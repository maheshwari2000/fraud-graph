Building something like TigerDB (Graph Analysis) using LLMs
AI-Powered Financial & Fraud Detection Agent (Graph + LLM)
Why?
Combines LLMs with Graph Analysis (Memgraph/TigerGraph).
Detects financial fraud patterns using graph-based anomaly detection + LLM for reasoning.
Can be extended into a published research paper in AI for Finance.
How?
Use LLMs as investigative agents that analyze transactions.
Create a knowledge graph from transactions & user behavior.
Apply graph-based fraud detection algorithms (PageRank, Community Detection).
Use LLMs for explanation & reasoning on why a transaction is suspicious.
Tech: Memgraph/TigerGraph, LangChain, Hugging Face, Neo4j.
Research Direction:
Can LLMs improve fraud detection in low-data regimes?
How effective are LLM-agent explanations in fraud reasoning?
